      <h1> Flower Meaning </h1>
          <p>The symbolic language of flowers has been recognized 
              for centuries in many countries throughout Europe and Asia. 
              They even play a large role in William Shakespeare’s works. 
              Mythologies, folklore, sonnets, and plays of the ancient Greeks, Romans, 
              Egyptians, and Chinese are peppered with flower and plant symbolism—and for good reason. 
              <br>
              Nearly every sentiment imaginable can be expressed with flowers. 
              The orange blossom, for instance, means chastity, purity, and loveliness, 
              while the red chrysanthemum means “I love you.”</p>
          <p>In the Victorian era, flowers were primarily used to deliver messages 
              that couldn’t be spoken aloud. In a sort of silent dialogue, 
              flowers could be used to answer “yes” or “no” questions. 
              A “yes” answer came in the form of flowers handed over with the right hand;
              if the left hand was used, the answer was “no.”
